MIT BWSI Autonomous Drone Racing Course - UAV Neo

File Name: flight_real.py
File Description: Contains the Flight module of the drone_core library.
Publishes setpoints directly to MAVROS. Velocity commands (send_pcmd) go to
/mavros/setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel; position commands (goto_position) go to
/mavros/setpoint_position/local for PX4's position controller. Only one setpoint
type streams at a time. takeoff() and land() instead command PX4's native
AUTO.TAKEOFF / AUTO.LAND modes through the set_mode service and let the flight
controller own the vertical maneuver; start_offboard() switches back to OFFBOARD
so streamed setpoints regain control. Does NOT arm - the safety pilot does that on
the RC transmitter and retains override by leaving OFFBOARD.
